Re-instate favourites functionality: Tap the 'Star' button in the app to find out more about how favourites work and start adding your favourite signs! You may notice that we request a new permission for this update - "Write External Storage". We ask for this permission so that we can store sign videos. Only the signs you have picked as favourites will be stored, and you can clear these signs at any time to remove the corresponding files.
